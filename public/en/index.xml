      <description>TL;DRThe outputs of polynomial regression can be difficult to interpret. I generated some animated plots to see how model predictions change across different combinations of coefficients for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree polynomials.
Why polynomialsWhen modelling data using regression, sometimes the relationship between input variables and output variables is not very well captured by a straight line. A standard linear model is defined by the equation</description>

      <description>The ubiquity of masks has given psycholinguists a frequent-ish stimulus to use in experiments. This word is more form-similar across languages than one may think. I gathered a big-ish dataset with translation equivalents of the word mask across ~110 languages. I tweeted about this today, and wanted to dedicate some more lines to nuance.
